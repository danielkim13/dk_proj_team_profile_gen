<h2 align="center"><b>About the Project</b></h4>

<p>The challenge is to create a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. <br />
Will be writing unit tests along the way to build maintainable codes.</p>

<hr />

<h4><u>User Story</u></h4>

AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

<h4><u>Acceptance Criteria</u></h4>

<p><b>GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input</b></p>

    - #1: WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
          THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

    - #2: WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
          THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

    - #3: WHEN I click on the GitHub username
          THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

    - #4: WHEN I start the application
          THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number

    - #5: WHEN I enter the team manager‚Äôs name, employee ID, email address, and office number
          THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

    - #6: WHEN I select the engineer option
          THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer‚Äôs name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

    - #7: WHEN I select the intern option
          THEN I am prompted to enter the intern‚Äôs name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

    - #8: WHEN I decide to finish building my team
          THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
